I'm a lecturer at City, University of London where I teach Information Security Fundamentals and Cryptography. I did my PhD in networking at the University Grenoble Alpes in France and spent several years as a research associate at University College London, University of California, Los Angeles and UCLouvain in Belgium.
My research research interest include blockchains, distributed systems and privacy-preserving communication.
